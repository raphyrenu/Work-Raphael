React Node.js Starter
A starter template for a full-stack application using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes with Node.js installation.
Git: If you plan to clone the repository, you need Git installed. You can download it from git-scm.com.
Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies.


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-nodejs-starter.git
cd react-nodejs-starter
npm install
Usage
Running the Application
To run the React app and Node.js server concurrently:


npm run dev
This command will start both the React development server and the Node.js server.


React App: Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
Node.js Backend: APIs are accessible at http://localhost:3001.
Other Commands


Testing:
npm test

Runs tests using Jest.

Building for Production:
npm run build


Builds the production-ready app in the build directory.
